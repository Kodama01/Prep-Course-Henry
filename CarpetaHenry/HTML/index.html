    <h2>Informacion General</h2>
    <main>
        <p>If you're not careful and noclip out of reality in the wrong areas, you'll end up in the Backrooms, 
        where it's nothing but the stink of old moist carpet, the madness of mono-yellow, the endless background
        noise of fluorescent lights at maximum hum-buzz, and approximately six hundred million square miles of
        randomly segmented empty rooms to be trapped in. God save you if you hear something wandering around 
        nearby, because it sure as hell has heard you.</p>
        <p>The Backrooms are an <strong>online urban legend</strong> originating from a creepypasta posted on a 2019 4chan thread. 
        One of the most well-known examples of the Internet aesthetic of liminal spaces, which depicts usually 
        busy locations as unnaturally empty, the Backrooms was first described as a maze of empty office rooms 
        that can only be entered by "noclipping out of reality".</p>
